"""
Script which contains the main logic of the app, putting all together

The process consist of the following steps:

1 - Drop the bundle if it exists and create it again (for now, in behalf of simplicity, so we will not have to calculate deltas)

2 - Download Power Bi reports from the Power BI Report Server and extract their M scripts

3 - Parse the M scripts and get the metadata ready for loading on IGC(which is XML oriented)

4 - generate the XML from metadata and upload it to IGC
